# Aurelia Highcharts

This project holds my current integration with HighCharts required for a project I'm working on. It's not a complete integration and only accomplishes the basics of what I require. That said I may come back and improve on it in the future.

I've also published a [blog post](http://blog.philiphendry.me.uk/2015/09/15/creating-a-highchart-component-in-aurelia) that describes some of the technicalities I've covered.
